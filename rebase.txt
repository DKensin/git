1. purpose
    - both of "git rebase" and "git merge" are designed to integrate changes from one branch into another branch
    - consider what happen when:
        + you start working on a new feature in a dedicated branch
        + another team member updates the "master" branch with new commit

2. git merge
    - how to merge from master to feature
        + git checkout feature
        + git merge master
    - this create a new "merge commit" in the feature branch that ties together the histories of both branches

3. git rebase
    - how to rebase:
        + git checkout feature
        + git rebase master
    - this move the entire "feature branch" to begin on the tip of the "master" branch
    - it re-writes the project history by create brand new commits for each commit in the original branch
