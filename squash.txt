1. Git Squash
    - Not a command, instead it is a keyword
    - used to squash the previous commits into one
    - can also squash commits if already have created a pull request

2. How to squash
    Step 1. check the commit history
        git log --oneline   => display the distory in one line

    Step2. chose the commits to squash
        + suppose want to squash 3 last commits => checkout the commit previous of all 3 last commits
            git rebase -i HEAD~3
        or  git rebase -i <after_this_commit>
        => will open a text editor with some options:
            - p, pick <commit> = use commit
            - s, squash <commit> = use commit, but meld into previous commit
                => use to merge previous commits into a single commit: replace "pick" to "squash"

    Step3. update the commits
        + on press "enter" key, new window of text editor will be opened to confirm that commit
        + edit text editor, if commits not want to keep, add # before commit content
        + check with git log
        + basic, git squash git create a new branch, contain all commits in a single commit

    Step4. push the squased commit
        git push origin <current_branch>
    or  git push -f origin master: delete old branch, HEAD will point to new branch
